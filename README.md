# Proyecto 1: Word counting using Python

## Parallelism and Distributed computing

### Notes:

`MapReduce.py` is the working file.

- Counting is working and being parallelized correctly; however, a method must be implemented to show the parallelism graphically.
- Implement checkpoints to keep track of each step of the process. For example, prompt "Continue? Y/N" after split, map, and reduce steps. This way, every part of the process is explicitly demonstrated as functional.
- Consider making it truly distributed computing, perhaps using your computers as a cluster.
