",rob schneider is a famous comedian cause of his movements facials and performances of not humans this time he is the animal marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day nobody takes a call from a man that gets attacked so marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man but on his way to the crime scene he crashes with his car and gets really damaged he doesnt remember what happens and at the next ordinary day his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts of course we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his tryings are useless she is played by collen haskell there are no negative characters the negative character is destiny if i could use this metaphor marvin should find out how to become a normal human being again by the wayhis animal instincts helps him in some situations schneiders performance is a soso the movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies called mindless fun as i have written above so watch it for the monkey style rob schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that schneider appears in he is a great comedian but this is not his best movie

",theres a lot of movies that have set release dates only to get pulled from distribution due to a legal snafu of some kind and then put in limbo for a long time you can only wish a film as rotten as slackers remained in a coma for what its worth which is miniscule release dates were continually shifted around for this truly awful movie that is so much a bleep on the radar like it deserves the premise kicks off under the guise of ethan a creepy nerd with a scary obsession for the campus bombshell angela ethan devilishly enlists the aid of david and his friends who have been scamming the school for their entire run with blackmail to help win angela i dont like to give spoilers out but for a piece of crap like this i can make an exception angela falls for david ethan intentionally screws everything up the good guys win thats what happens in a nutshell for another tired retread of the teen gross out genre gross humor is funny it always has been dating back to the days of the immortal classic animal house to the likes of contemporaries like theres something about mary and road trip amongst dozens of others of which there are too many to mention but when you use it as a plot point you can only get so far case in point ethan has an angela doll composed of her individual strands of hair of which he does god knows what with it no one wants to take witness to watch ethan urinating in the shower while singing to himself no one wants to watch a young man singing shell be coming around the mountain with a sock on his penis but nothing can prepare you for the full visual assault of seeing 50s bombshell mamie van doren bare her breasts at 71 years old i dont know if its the storys lack of coherence which cuts to scenes that make absolutely no sense director dewey nicks was a former fashion photographer and after reviewing this film you can only wish hell go back to the profession the worst thing you can do on any film is to make it look like youre having fun because you detract from your objectives just like slackers does by burying its plot outline under a pile of gross out gags pointless vignettes and lack of construction its like a bunch of college students got drunk took ones camcorder and shot a bunch of random crap and compiled it together if you want to see a teen gross out comedy thats actually good then i suggest american pie and animal house or road trip just something thats entertaining and not dreadfully bad like slackers coincidentally cameron diaz makes a cameo in this film just as she did in another bad film such as the sweetest thing where the story treats gross humor like another plot instead of a device much like this disaster if you pass by slackers at your local video store just keep on walking and let it end up at the bottom of the shelf like it deserves

",given the people involved it is hard to see why this movie should be so messed up and dull the writer david ward wrote the amazing caper film the sting two years later jane fonda had just won an academy award for klute and donald sutherland had just done excellent work in films like klute start the revolution without me and kellys heroes plotwise the movie is a caper tale with a small gang of bumbling misfits planning a big heist at the same time the movie wants to be hip satire a series of comedy sketches of the type that the nbc television show saturday night would do so well two years later the bad result is that the plot makes the comedy bits seem awkward and forced and the disconnected comedy bits destroy any kind of suspense that the heist might have it is quite literally a movie that keeps smashing into itself just as the cars in the cars in the demolition scenes run into each otherbr br the only real interest for me was watching jane fonda her iris caine is supposed to be a light hearted version of her dramatic bree daniels prostitute character in klute yet one doesnt believe her for a moment it is always jane fonda pretending to be a prostitute that we are watching it is as terrible a performance as her performance in klute was terrific it would be a good lesson for acting teachers to run the two films together to show how the same actress in the same type of role can be great or pathetic it suggests that actors are only as good as their writers and directors

",everything a great documentary could be yeah if one is deaf dumb and blind everything but meaning wit visual style and interesting subject matter aside from that  br br seriously volken this is a movie that is completely inauthentic an adventure doc with no adventure a war doc with no feeling for war a campy sendup with no trace of wit it means nothing feels like nothing and carries the implicit message that absolutely nothing matters no wonder it has so many imdb fans of course going in you know a movie starring the great skip lipman will have no culture no intelligence no wit other than a corrosive adolescent jokiness and no recognizable human emotion  just adrenaline darkon isnt a movie  its a panic attack avoid there too many real documentaries and too little time in life to waste it on toilet buildup such as darkon
